All of these actions allege that the defendants are liable because they disseminated, approved, or failed to appropriately supervise allegedly false and misleading statements about ExxonMobil’s use of “proxy costs of carbon,” the profitability of its Canadian bitumen operations, its compliance with SEC regulations regarding its proved reserves, and certain of its asset impairment assessments.","{

"Defendants will undeniably suffer significant hardship by being forced to litigate the same issues in this Court that will be adjudicated in the Texas Derivative Action and Ramirez. In addition to the needless waste of their resources, Defendants will face the substantial risk of inconsistent rulings from this Court and the Northern District of Texas.
