    "II.             Regular Expressions Used in Rules\t\t\t\n",
    "RX(.*?) A token that can be any word, punctuation mark, or symbol.\t\t\t\n",
    "RX([a-zA-Z]*) A token that can be any word.\t\t\t\n",
    "RX([a-zA-Z]+) A token that can be any word.\t\t\t\n",
    "III. Rules\t\t\t\n",
    "Rules consist of a number of tokens, some are required and some are optional.\t\t\t\n",
    "In the corrections, the first token is referred to as $0, the second $1, and so forth.\t\t\t\n",
    "If at least one word or tag or regular expression appears inside parentheses/brackets, the entire string, including the parentheses/brackets, is considered a single token.\t\t\t\n",
    "If at least two words or tags or regular expressions appear inside parentheses/brackets and if there is no “~” symbol at the end of the string, then any one of those words or tags or regular expressions is a required token in the string.\t\t\t\n",
    "If at least one word or tag or regular expression appears inside parentheses/brackets and if there is a “~” symbol at the end of the string, then any one of those words or tags or regular expressions is an optional token in the string.\t\t\t\n",
    "When a word or Part of Speech tag is preceded by “!”, that word or tag is excluded from the token. For example, \"( CT(be) !been )\" would include \"be\", \"is\", \"am\", \"are\", and \"was\", \"were\", and \"being\", but it would not include \"been\". Thus, the rule \"( CT(be) !been ) happy\" would flag \"He was happy\" but not \"He had been happy\".\t\t\t\n",
    "“SKIP” is always followed by a cardinal number. The number tells you how many tokens can come between the preceding token and the next one. The string “dog SKIP4 cat”, for example, would flag “The dog likes the cat” but would not flag “The dog likes the neighbor’s old cat,” nor would it flag “The cat likes the dog”.\t\t\t\n",
    "A backward slash “\\” before a word means a special character or case-sensitive.\t\t\t\n",
    "“CT” refers to the infinitive form of a verb that can be conjugated. “CT(read)”, for example, could be “reads”, “read”, “reading”, etc.\t\t\t\n",
    "IV.          Corrections\t\t\t\n",
    "Corrections in the example tag provide the text that will replace everything inside the `marker` tags. Make sure when creating these, the corrected sentence would make sense when substituting in the correction. This would include no overlapping or duplicated words. However, and this is very important, if a word does not match the pattern for the rule, do not include it in the correction or within the marker tags.\n",
    "Sometimes a rule has more than one possible correction. In that case, multiple alternative corrections are separated by the “@” symbol.\t\t\t\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Important Notes:\n",
    "- Always set the rule id to `{new_rule_id}`\n",
    "- Only return the rule XML, do not introduce it or wrap it with back ticks.\n",
    "- If the ad hoc version has a part of speech tag in the same parentheses as suggestions, use the `<or>...</or>` tag with the part of speech tag as one token and the other options as a regexp token. for example with the input: \n",
    "keep the change ( NNPS how that when)\n",
    "the output pattern would be:\n",
    "<pattern>\n",
    "  <token>keep</token>\n",
    "  <token>the</token>\n",
    "  <token>change</token>\n",
    "  <or>\n",
    "    <token postag=\"NNPS\"/>\n",
    "    <token regexp=\"yes\">how|that|when</token>\n",
    "  </or>\n",
    "</pattern>\n",
    "  - Note how the or tag is applied ONLY when the part of speech tag is inside the same parentheses as \"how that when\". Do not use the or tag if a part of speech tag is separate from other options. If using the or tag, make sure to use the regexp field and include multiple options in one token separated by `|`.\n",
    "- The only instance that marker tags should be in the pattern is if there is a SENT_START postag in a token in the pattern. In this case, all tokens that succeed the SENT_START token need to be nested within marker tags, so that the SENT_START token is applied correctly.\n",
    "- When converting the explanation to the message tag, make sure to convert any HTML notation to its markdown equivalent.\n",
    "- The exception tags are only used for words that are marked with `!`. If you see you need to make an exception tag, make a note of this in your thoughts to determine which group of options needs to be exceptions and which are regular regexp.\n",

      "<THOUGHT>The ad hoc rule starts with SENT_START which indicates the beginning of a sentence. The pattern includes a fixed phrase \"in that case,\" followed by a choice between \"however\" and \"though,\" and then another choice between several pronouns and the word \"if.\" Since SENT_START is present, all tokens following it must be nested within marker tags. The correction offers three alternatives, using \"But,\" \"Then,\" and \"But then\" followed by the last token from the pattern, which is a pronoun or \"if.\" The explanation includes an example and needs to be converted to markdown for the message tag. The corrected sentence shows that the phrase \"in that case, however,\" is replaced by \"But,\" which aligns with the first correction option.</THOUGHT>\n",
