I have chosen a single case to illustrate this point: Hammer v. Ashcroft.190 The case concerned a policy that the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) adopted about press access to inmates in the Special Confinement Unit (SCU) of the prison at Terre Haute, Indiana--the unit that houses federal prisoners under a sentence of death.191 At one time, reporters were able freely to interview inmates housed in the SCU.192 But in March 2000, CBS News aired an interview with Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, on its 60 Minutes show.193 McVeigh used the interview as an opportunity to justify his *1474 actions and to extol terrorism.194 Shortly after the broadcast, Senator Byron Dorgan wrote to the Director of the BOP complaining about it; Senator Dorgan felt that a prisoner like McVeigh should not be able to use a forum like 60 Minutes to advance his agenda of violence.195 Attorney General John Ashcroft and the Director responded with a new regulation for the SCU.196 According to the majority opinion, the new rule "bans person-to-person meetings between reporters and inmates of the Special Confinement Unit, though it allows phone calls and correspondence."197 Phone calls with reporters are subject to another limitation under which a reporter may not "obtain and use personal information from one inmate about another inmate who refuses to be interviewed."198 Correspondence with the press, according to the majority, is unlimited and not subject to inspection or censorship.199 On that understanding of the legal framework, the majority held that inmate Hammer's challenge to the rules on First Amendment grounds had to fail.200 The Supreme Court's decisions in Pell v. Procunier201 and Saxbe v. Washington Post Co.,202 which held respectively that news reporters have no greater constitutional right of access to prison inmates than the general public and that the BOP was entitled to ban face-to-face interviews, doomed Hammer's case.,
