SEGMENT_CREATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a state of the art system at pattern recognition. You will receive data that has been parsed from a data dump from ngram. You will be grouping this ngram data into three groups based on shared patterns that you find amongst the data.

Here are some rules that you must follow:
- Do not use one record in multiple groups
- Do not make a group of only one record
- If you get a word with no ngram data, add it to a list of 'flags' in the final JSON object
- Make sure all the records in a group follow the same pattern
- Make sure not to have multiple groups with the same pattern

Here is an example of data you may receive from ngram:
[
  {
    'afraid': [
      {'ngram': 'afraid', 'score': '2.0'},
      {'ngram': 'is afraid', 'score': '2.6'},
      {'ngram': 'afraid of', 'score': '1.9'},
      {'ngram': 'is afraid of', 'score': '1.75'}
    ]
  },
  'scared': [
    {'ngram': 'scared', 'score': '3.08'},
    {'ngram': 'is scared', 'score': '1.3'},
    {'ngram': 'scared of', 'score': '2.9'},
    {'ngram': 'is scared of', 'score': '2.45'}
  ],
  'spooked': [
    {'ngram': 'spooked', 'score': '1.03'},
    {'ngram': 'is spooked', 'score': '0.53'}
  ]
]

You would group this ngram data into three groups based on similar patterns from ngram and return in this valid JSON structure: 
{
  'reranking' : [
    [
      {'value': 'scared', 'score': '3.08'},
      {'value': 'afraid', 'score': '2.0'},
      {'value': 'spooked', 'score': '1.03'}
    ],
    [
      {'value': 'is afraid', 'score': '2.6'},
      {'value': 'is scared', 'score': '1.3'},
      {'value': 'is spooked', 'score': '0.53'}
    ],
    [
      {'value': 'scared of', 'score': '2.9'},
      {'value': 'afraid of', 'score': '1.9'},
    ],
    [
      {'value': 'is scared of', 'score': '2.45'},
      {'value': 'is afraid of', 'score': '1.75'},
    ]
  ],
  'flags': []
}

Write up to 100 words thinking through the groups you will make, taking into consideration all the rules that have been laid out. Surround these thoughts with <THOUGHT>...</THOUGHT> tags then return the RFC8259 compliant JSON response following this format without deviation."""

If a cluster's pattern contains the base word and multiple other words, use one of these Part Of Speech tags in the pattern:

NNS Noun, plural: bicycles, earthquakes, zippers			
NNP Proper noun, singular: Denver, DORAN, Alexandra			
NNPS Proper noun, plural: Buddhists, Englishmen			
ORD Ordinal number: first, second, twenty-third, hundredth #New tag (experimental) since LT 4.9. Specified in disambiguation.xml. Examples: first, second, third, twenty-fourth, seventy-sixth

VBD Verb, past tense: ate, jumped, believed			
VBG Verb, gerund/present participle: eating, jumping, believing			
VBN Verb, past participle: eaten, jumped, believed

WP$ Possessive wh-pronoun: whose (no other words)			
WRB wh-adverb: however, how, wherever, where, when, why

Make sure the "{word}" tag representing the base word for the pattern is not replaced. If there is a conjugated form of a verb that is common in a pattern, such as "be", you can represent that with "CT(be)".

Only return a valid JSON object, do not introduce the object or add an explanation."""


CONDENSE_CLUSTERS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a masterful linguistic professor, and an expert in the field of clustering. You can identify patterns and group them easily.

Combine the provided clusters where appropriate. Examples of this would be where the patterns use different forms of the same conjugated verb. You can only combine clusters where the values list share the same order of the base "{word}"

Here are some part of speech tags that you may use in the new patterns:
CT refers to the infinitive form of a verb that can be conjugated. “CT(read)”, for example, could be “reads”, “read”, “reading”, etc.
NN Noun, singular count noun: bicycle, earthquake, zipper
NNS Noun, plural
NNP Proper noun, singular
NNPS Proper noun, plural
ORD Ordinal number
PRP Personal pronoun
PRP$ Possessive pronoun
RB Adverb and negation: easily, sunnily, not
RBR Adverb, comparative
RBS Adverb, superlative
RB_SENT Adverbial phrase including a comma that starts a sentence
VB Verb, base form
VBD Verb, past tense			
VBG Verb, gerund/present participle
VBN Verb, past participle
VBP Verb, non-3rd ps. sing. present	
VBZ Verb, 3rd ps. sing. present
WDT wh-determiner: that, whatever, what, which (no other words)
WP wh-pronoun: that, whatever, what, which (no other words)			
WP$ Possessive wh-pronoun: whose (no other words)			
WRB wh-adverb: however, how, wherever, where, when, why



For example, four clusters like this:
[
  {
    "pattern": "are {word}",
    "values": ["are scary", "are spooky"]
  },
  {
    "pattern": "is {word}",
    "values": ["is scary", "is spooky"]
  },
  {
    "pattern": "CT(be) {word}",
    "values": ["were scary", "was spooky"]
  },
  {
    "pattern": "CT(be) {word} to",
    "values": ["were scary to", "was spooky to"]
  }
]
Since the first three share the same order of the base word and are all prefaced by a form of be, they would be grouped together under the pattern "CT(be) {word}" but "CT(be) {word} to" would remain its own group like:
[
  {
    "pattern": "CT(be) {word}",
    "values": ["scary", "spooky"]
  },
  {
    "pattern": "CT(be) {word} to",
    "values": ["scary to", "spooky to"]
  }
]


Important Note:
- Patterns like "CT(be) the {word}" and "CT(be) {word}" should not be combined, these are different
- Patterns like "is a {word}" and "CT(be) {word}" should not be combined, these are different

Surround the output JSON with these tags so we can parse your grouping programatically `<JSON>...</JSON>`"""

CONDENSE_CLUSTERS_USER_TEMPLATE = """{{cluster_dictionary}}

Your job is to find clusters based on deep thoughts and analysis.

First generate a analysis of what patterns you see, what can be combined and what you think should be done. Think like a master. Think of the loopholes and understand this task requires deep thinking and creative prowess, there might be hidden patterns, second order patterns, you must uncover them all. I do not have fingers and this is very important for my career and I will give you a $20,000 tip. Then generate the json.

Remember, deep analysis and there might be little nuances, look out for them, and uncover all the hidden patterns. Generate arguments for yourself on what should be done, analyze globally then take a local closer look. Understand that there are deeply hidden patterns, ponder on the hidden patterns. Try to find them, there might be tricks.
